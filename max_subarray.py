# max_subarray
# Given an array arr[], the task is to find the subarray that has the maximum sum and return its sum.

# Examples:

# Input: arr[] = {2, 3, -8, 7, -1, 2, 3}
# Output: 11
# Explanation: The subarray {7, -1, 2, 3} has the largest sum 11.

# Input: arr[] = {-2, -4}
# Output: â€“2
# Explanation: The subarray {-2} has the largest sum -2.

# Input: arr[] = {5, 4, 1, 7, 8}
# Output: 25
# Explanation: The subarray {5, 4, 1, 7, 8} has the largest sum 25.

    # what if we kept track of a total sum as we traverse the array then if ever that sum
    # goes negative then we store the total as a max then continue down the array.
