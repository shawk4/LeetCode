# Given an array arr[] of size N-1 with integers in the range of [1, N], the task is to find the missing number from the first N integers.
# 
# Note: There are no duplicates in the list.
# 
# Examples: 
# 
# Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 4, 6, 3, 7, 8} , N = 8
# Output: 5
# Explanation: Here the size of the array is 8, so the range will be [1, 8]. The missing number between 1 to 8 is 5
# 
# Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 5}, N = 5
# Output: 4
# Explanation: Here the size of the array is 4, so the range will be [1, 5]. The missing number between 1 to 5 is 4

n = int(input())

for i in range(n):
    length = int(input())
    arr = map(int, input().split(','))
    expectedTotal = length*(length+1)/2
    total = sum(arr)
    print(expectedTotal-total)
